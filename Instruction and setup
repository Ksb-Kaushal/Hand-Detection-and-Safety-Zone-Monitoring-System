## Admin: defining the Area of Interest (AOI)
1. Run `python Hand_Safety.py`. Window `Hand AOI Monitor` will open.
2. Press `d` to enter drawing mode.
3. Left click to add polygon points around the machine danger area.
4. Right click to finish and set the AOI. At least 3 points required.
5. Press `r` to restore default AOI.
6. The system splits the AOI into a yellow and red zone. Yellow gives a warning, red triggers recording and PLC output.

Notes:
- To test without camera, set `cap = cv2.VideoCapture("path/to/demo.mp4")` inside `run()`.
- Update YOLO model path and save folder inside the script before running.
